Just feel free and be expressive
First Week @ Lecture
Well so far so good, I have had a great learning experience with my cohort colleagues and Instructors. Very nice people. Has been fun and challenging, quite contrary right? but yes, the learning sessions, discussions and after-hours consultation with Instructors and friends has addressed my concerns. I hope this continues to the end and I hope to be an active helper as best as I can.
